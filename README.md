# Auto Retaliate Warning

Warns you when you have auto retaliate enabled. Additional options to hide the auto retaliate button, warn you when NPC attack options aren't hidden, and when auto retaliate is off. Warning messages / colours / font size are all customizeable.

Mostly useful to limited accounts that don't want to gain accidental combat XP by misclicking NPCs / auto retaliating.
